# MonteCarloSimulation
Built a python program for Monty Carlo Simulation to estimates the probability of occurrence of an undeterminable event due to the involvement of random variables.
 The algorithm relies on repeated random sampling in an attempt to determine the probability. This means simulating an event with random inputs a large number of times to obtain your estimation. You can determine other factors as well, and we will see that in the example. Monte Carlo simulations can be utilized in a broad range of fields spanning from economics, gambling, engineering, energy, and anything in-between.


Learning case

Our simple game will involve two six-sided dice. In order to win, the player needs to roll the same number on both dice. A six-sided die has six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). With two dice, there is now 36 possible outcomes (1 and 1, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc., or 6 x 6 = 36 possibilities). In this game, the house has more opportunities to win (30 outcomes vs. the player’s 6 outcomes), meaning the house has the quite the advantage.
Let’s say our player starts with a balance of $1,000 and is prepared to lose it all, so they bet $1 on every roll (meaning both dice are rolled) and decide to play 1,000 rolls. Because the house is so generous, they offer to payout 4 times the player’s bet when the player wins
