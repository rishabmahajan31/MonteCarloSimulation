# MontyCarloSimulation
Built a python program for Monty Carlo Simulation to estimates the probability of occurrence of an undeterminable event due to the involvement of random variables.
 The algorithm relies on repeated random sampling in an attempt to determine the probability. This means simulating an event with random inputs a large number of times to obtain your estimation. You can determine other factors as well, and we will see that in the example. Monte Carlo simulations can be utilized in a broad range of fields spanning from economics, gambling, engineering, energy, and anything in-between.
